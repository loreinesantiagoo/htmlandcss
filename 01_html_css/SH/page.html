                <strong class="my-strong">Sherlock Holmes</strong>(/ˈʃɜːrlɒk ˈhoʊmz/) is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir
                Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for
                his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic,
                which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard. First appearing
                in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became widespread with the first series
                of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales
                appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set
                in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's
                friend and biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares
                quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin. Though not
                the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known, with Guinness World Records listing
                him as the "most portrayed movie character" in history.[1] Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many
                have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;[2][3][4] numerous literary and fan
                societies have been founded that pretend to operate on this principle. Widely considered a British cultural
                icon, the character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture
                as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being
                adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred
                years.
